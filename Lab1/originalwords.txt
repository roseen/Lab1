They
wanted
to
speak
but
could
not
tears
stood
in
their
eyes
They
were
both
pale
and
thin
but
those
sick
pale
faces
were
bright
with
the
dawn
of
a
new
future
of
a
full
resurrection
into
a
new
life
They
were
renewed
by
love
the
heart
of
each
held
infinite
sources
of
life
for
the
heart
of
the
other
Go
at
once
this
very
minute
stand
at
the
crossroads
bow
down
first
kiss
the
earth
which
you
have
defiled
and
then
bow
down
to
all
the
world
and
say
to
all
men
aloud
I
am
a
murderer
Then
God
will
send
you
life
again
Will
you
go
will
you
go
What
was
taking
place
in
him
was
totally
unfamiliar
new
sudden
never
before
experienced
Not
that
he
understood
it
but
he
sensed
clearly
with
all
the
power
of
sensation
that
it
was
no
longer
possible
for
him
to
address
these
people
in
the
police
station
not
only
with
heartfelt
effusions
as
he
had
just
done
but
in
any
way
at
all
and
had
they
been
his
own
brothers
and
sisters
and
not
police
lieutenants
there
would
still
have
been
no
point
in
this
addressing
them
in
whatever
circumstances
of
life
What
is
it
to
run
away
A
mere
formality
thats
not
the
main
thing
no
he
wont
run
away
on
me
by
a
law
of
nature
even
if
he
has
somewhere
to
run
to
Have
you
ever
seen
a
moth
near
a
candle
Well
so
hell
keep
circling
around
me
circling
around
me
as
around
a
candle
freedom
will
no
longer
be
dear
to
him
hell
fall
to
thinking
get
entangled
hell
tangle
himself
all
up
as
in
a
net
hell
worry
himself
to
death
hell
keep
on
making
circles
around
me
narrowing
the
radius
more
and
more
andwhop
Hell
fly
right
into
my
mouth
and
Ill
swallow
him
sir
and
that
will
be
most
agreeable
heh
heh
heh
How
it
happened
he
himself
did
not
know
but
suddenly
it
was
as
if
something
lifted
him
and
flung
him
down
at
her
feet
He
wept
and
embraced
her
knees
For
the
first
moment
she
was
terribly
frightened
and
her
whole
face
went
numb
She
jumped
up
and
looked
at
him
trembling
But
all
at
once
in
that
same
moment
she
understood
everything
Infinite
happiness
lit
up
in
her
eyes
she
understood
and
for
her
there
was
no
longer
any
doubt
that
he
loved
her
loved
her
infinitely
and
that
at
last
the
moment
had
come
The
lodgers
one
after
another
squeezed
back
into
the
doorway
with
that
strange
inner
feeling
of
satisfaction
which
may
be
observed
in
the
presence
of
a
sudden
accident
even
in
those
nearest
and
dearest
to
the
victim
from
which
no
living
man
is
exempt
even
in
spite
of
the
sincerest
sympathy
and
compassion
